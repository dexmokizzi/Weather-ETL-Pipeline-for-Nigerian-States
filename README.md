# Weather-ETL-Pipeline-for-Nigerian-States
A robust Python-based data pipeline that extracts daily weather metrics from Meteostat, transforms them to ensure consistency and avoid duplicates, and loads the data into a PostgreSQL database. This project demonstrates best practices in ETL design, logging, and scheduling, providing a scalable foundation for real-time analytics and dashboards.
